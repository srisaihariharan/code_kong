###  How to Use It

1. Copy and paste this template into a new `README.md` in your repo.
2. Customize sections like "Features" and "Project Structure" to align with your actual codebase—especially what's inside `src/`.
3. Optionally, add:
   - **Screenshots** or GIFs for visual clarity.
   - **Live demo link** if you deploy somewhere (like Vercel).
   - **Badges** showing build status, license, or framework used.

Let me know if you want help tailoring it further or adding extra sections (like explainability, testing, or deployment tips).
