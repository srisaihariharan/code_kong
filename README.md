**Alternative Credit Scoring Platform**

A fast, modern frontend built using **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to power an alternative credit scoring application.

##  Features

- **Modern dev stack**: Vite for lightning-fast reloading, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first layout using Tailwind utility classes.
- **Modular code**: Structured components under `src/` for scalable development.

###  How to Use It

1. Copy and paste this template into a new `README.md` in your repo.
2. Customize sections like "Features" and "Project Structure" to align with your actual codebase—especially what's inside `src/`.
3. Optionally, add:
   - **Screenshots** or GIFs for visual clarity.
   - **Live demo link** if you deploy somewhere (like Vercel).
   - **Badges** showing build status, license, or framework used.

Let me know if you want help tailoring it further or adding extra sections (like explainability, testing, or deployment tips).
